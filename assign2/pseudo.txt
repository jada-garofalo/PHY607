Falling Cow Simulator -- pseudocode -- Carter, Jada, Will

0. Import packages
  a. numpy
  b. matplotlib

1. Initialize parameters
  a. mass
  b. drag coefficient
  c. small g
  d. t = 0
  e. time step (tentatively 0.1)
  f. initial position and velocity vectors

2. Quantitative functions
  a. Total force vector
    i. For an inputted velocity vector, find the force caused by drag and gravity from given forms. Take into account components using numpy arrays and remember to include vector directionality.
    ii. Add up the forces!
    iii. Return this sum of forces as a 2D numpy array.
  b. Movement step
    i. Current position, velocity, force, time step as inputs.
    ii. Evaluates next set of parameters across a small time step (acceleration found from the force calculation, then new velocity from this acceleration, then the new position).
    iii. Return these new parameters.
  c. Potential, kinetic, and total energy
    i. Input of position and velocity.
    ii. Calculates potential and kinetic energy from classical forms, adds them together to get total energy.
    iii. Returns these three energies.

3. Style!
  a. Returning parameters (t, r, v), (Potential, KE, Total)
