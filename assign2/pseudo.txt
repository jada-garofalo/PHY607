Falling Cow Simulator -- pseudocode -- Carter, Jada, Will

0. Import packages
  a. numpy
  b. matplotlib

1. Initialize parameters
  a. mass
  b. drag coefficient
  c. small g
  d. t = 0
  e. time step (tentatively 0.1)
  f. initial position and velocity vectors

2. Quantitative functions
  a. Total force vector
    i. For an inputted velocity vector, find the force caused by drag and gravity from given forms. Take into account components using numpy arrays and remember to include vector directionality.
    ii. Add up the forces!
    iii. Return this sum of forces as a 2D numpy array.
  b. Movement step
    i. Position, velocity, force
