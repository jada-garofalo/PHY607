A pip-installable package that uses various Monte Carlo methods to simulate n-body gravitational interactions.

Follow install directions in ../README.txt

Run nbody-run as a CLI command in terminal and provide a number of simulations to perform, and the script will output the corresponding results and plots per simulation. See main.py for defaults, and modify in-file as desired (if desired).
