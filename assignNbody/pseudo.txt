1. High-level script
    a. Set initial conditions

2. Simulation methods
    a. Initialize simulation
    b. Run simulation for # time steps
    c. Evolve by 1 time step
    e. Update positions
    f. Update velocities
    g. Check for particle-wall collisions
    h. Check for particle-ball collisions
    i. Check for ball-wall collisions
    j. Compute total energy
        i. Total kinetic energy of particles
        ii. Ball kinetic energy
    k. Compute ball acceleration from velocities

3. Plotting
    a. Total system energy over time - incl. also average particle energy and ball energy
    b. Force as a function of velocity
    c. Drag force, velocity as a function of time

4. Variables
    a. Particle positions & velocities stored as (N,2) arrays
    b. Ball position & velocity stored as (1,2) array
    c. Lists storing past system states - 4 total, storing particle positions & velocities and ball pos. & vel.
