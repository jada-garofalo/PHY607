Project 1 README.txt -- Jada Garofalo

Hello! Welcome to my submission for Project 1.

In this directory you will find four files:
  1. README.txt -- this file!
  2. report_proj1.pdf -- my report in .pdf format
  2. proj1.py -- this includes my two primary functions for Project 1
  3. test_proj1.py -- this includes my run tests for Project 1, and will also be the one you run to reproduce my results

To that last point, to reproduce the results in my report, please:
  1. Clone this repo / specifically the PHY607/proj1/ directory, or download the files independently
  2. Ensure proj1.py and test_proj1.py are in the same directory, and that you are called into said directory
  3. Simply run test_proj.py in the terminal (e.g. "python3 test_proj1.py")

Please ensure the following dependencies are installed, either on your system or current environment:
  1. numpy
  2. matplotlib
